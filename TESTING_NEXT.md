# Claude Code Plugin Testing - Handoff Document

**Status**: Plugin implementation complete, ready for testing
**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Session**: Plugin development and version management

## What Was Completed This Session

### 1. Claude Code Plugin (GitHub #28, bd-52)
‚úÖ Created complete plugin structure in `.claude-plugin/`:
- `plugin.json` - Metadata with MCP server configuration
- `marketplace.json` - Local marketplace config
- 9 slash commands in `commands/`
- 1 agent in `agents/`

‚úÖ Slash commands implemented:
- `/bd-ready` - Find ready work
- `/bd-create` - Create issues interactively
- `/bd-show` - Show issue details
- `/bd-update` - Update issues
- `/bd-close` - Close issues
- `/bd-workflow` - Show workflow guide
- `/bd-init` - Initialize beads
- `/bd-stats` - Project statistics
- `/bd-version` - Version compatibility checking

‚úÖ Documentation:
- `PLUGIN.md` - Complete plugin documentation
- Updated `README.md` with plugin section
- Updated `examples/README.md`

### 2. Version Management (bd-66, bd-67)
‚úÖ Fixed version inconsistencies:
- All components synced to 0.9.2
- bd CLI, Plugin, MCP server, README, PLUGIN.md

‚úÖ Created `scripts/bump-version.sh`:
- Automated version syncing across all files
- Validates semantic versioning
- Shows diff preview
- Auto-commit option

‚úÖ Updated `CLAUDE.md`:
- Added "Version Management" section
- Instructions for future agents on version bumps
- Common user phrases to recognize

### 3. Code Review
‚úÖ Comprehensive review identified and fixed:
- Commands were in wrong location (moved to `.claude-plugin/`)
- All issues addressed from review

## What Needs Testing (bd-64)

### Critical Tests

1. **Plugin Installation**
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace add steveyegge/beads
   /plugin install beads
   # Restart Claude Code
   ```

2. **Slash Commands**
   ```bash
   /bd-version        # Should show 0.9.2
   /bd-workflow       # Show workflow
   /bd-stats          # Project stats
   /bd-ready          # Find work
   /bd-create "Test" task 2
   ```

3. **MCP Server**
   ```bash
   /mcp               # Verify 'beads' appears
   ```

4. **Task Agent**
   ```bash
   @task-agent        # If supported
   ```

### Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **MCP Server Path**
   - Uses `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` variable
   - May need adjustment if not supported

2. **Prerequisites**
   - Requires `bd` CLI in PATH
   - Requires `uv` for Python MCP server

3. **Agent Syntax**
   - Task agent syntax may differ from `@task-agent`
   - May need adjustment based on Claude Code version

## Important Files for Next Agent

### Key Implementation Files
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - Plugin metadata
- `.claude-plugin/commands/*.md` - All 9 slash commands
- `.claude-plugin/agents/task-agent.md` - Autonomous agent
- `PLUGIN.md` - Complete documentation
- `scripts/bump-version.sh` - Version management script

### Key Documentation Files
- `CLAUDE.md` - **READ THIS FIRST** - Has version management instructions
- `PLUGIN.md` - Plugin user documentation
- `scripts/README.md` - Script documentation
- `bd-64` issue notes - Detailed testing instructions

### Commit History (for context)
```
a612b92 - docs: Add version management to CLAUDE.md
a5c71f0 - feat: Add version bump script
c0f1044 - fix: Sync all component versions to 0.9.2
d25fc53 - feat: Add version compatibility checking
9f38375 - feat: Add Claude Code plugin for beads
```

## How to Continue

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Read bd-64 notes (has complete testing instructions)
2. Install plugin from GitHub
3. Test all slash commands
4. Document any issues found
5. Fix issues or update documentation
6. Close bd-64 when testing complete

### If Plugin Testing Succeeds
1. Update bd-64 with test results
2. Close bd-64
3. Consider announcing plugin availability
4. Update PLUGIN.md if any corrections needed

### If Plugin Testing Fails
1. Document specific failures in bd-64
2. Create new issues for each problem
3. Link to bd-64 with `discovered-from`
4. Fix issues systematically
5. Retest

## User Context

The user (Steve) is working rapidly on beads, fixing "dozens of major bugs a day" (his words). He wants:

1. **Version Management**: Clear process for version bumps
   - Just say "bump to X.Y.Z" and agent should use script
   - All versions must stay in sync

2. **Plugin Testing**: Real-world GitHub installation test
   - Not local, use `steveyegge/beads` marketplace
   - Document any issues for iteration

3. **Clean Handoffs**: Each session should leave clear instructions
   - What was done
   - What needs doing
   - How to do it

## Important Notes

### Version Bumping
When user says any of:
- "Bump to 0.9.3"
- "Update version to X.Y.Z"
- "Rev the project to X.Y.Z"
- "Increment the version"

**You should:**
```bash
./scripts/bump-version.sh X.Y.Z --commit
git push origin main
```

See CLAUDE.md "Version Management" section for details.

### Plugin Development Status
- **Structure**: Complete ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: Complete ‚úÖ
- **Documentation**: Complete ‚úÖ
- **Testing**: Not started ‚è≥
- **Release**: Pending testing results

### Known Limitations
1. MCP server uses `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` - may need verification
2. Task agent syntax untested
3. Plugin requires separate bd CLI installation
4. No icon for marketplace (nice-to-have)

## Questions for Testing Agent

While testing, please document:
1. Did plugin install successfully from GitHub?
2. Did all slash commands work?
3. Did MCP server connect?
4. Were there any error messages?
5. Is documentation accurate?
6. What needs improvement?

## Success Criteria

Plugin is ready for users when:
- ‚úÖ Installs via `/plugin install beads`
- ‚úÖ All 9 slash commands work
- ‚úÖ MCP server connects and tools accessible
- ‚úÖ Version checking works correctly
- ‚úÖ Documentation is accurate
- ‚úÖ No major bugs or blocking issues

## Where We Are in the Bigger Picture

This plugin work relates to:
- **GitHub Issue #28**: Claude Code plugin request
- **bd-52**: Main plugin epic (now complete)
- **bd-64**: Testing task (next up)
- **Goal**: Make beads easy to install and use in Claude Code

The plugin leverages the existing MCP server (integrations/beads-mcp/) which is mature and tested. We're just packaging it nicely for Claude Code users.

---

**Next Agent**: Start by reading bd-64 notes, then test the plugin from GitHub. Good luck! üöÄ
